# BRIEF.md — Atomic Habits Companion App

Product name (working): Atomic Companion

## One-liner
A habit-building app that operationalises James Clear’s *Atomic Habits* framework with identity-first habit design, small-step execution, and a system for making habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.

## Source Framework (book-based)
This app is explicitly based on the practical mechanisms described in *Atomic Habits* (James Clear, 2018):
- Identity-based habits (become the kind of person who…)
- The habit loop: cue → craving → response → reward
- The 4 Laws of Behaviour Change:
  - Make it Obvious
  - Make it Attractive
  - Make it Easy
  - Make it Satisfying
- Supporting tactics: habit stacking, implementation intentions, environment design, the 2-minute rule, tracking & reflection.

## Problem
Most habit apps track streaks but don’t help users design habits that actually stick. People fail because the habit is vague, too hard, poorly cued, or not rewarding—then motivation collapses.

## Goals
1. Help users define habits as systems, not goals.
2. Make identity the “north star” and reinforce it through evidence.
3. Reduce friction to start (2-minute rule) and scale gradually.
4. Turn habit design into a guided, repeatable workflow.
5. Provide feedback loops (review, scoring, environment adjustments) that keep habits resilient.

## Non-goals (initially)
- Full therapy/wellbeing clinical claims or medical behaviour change programs.
- Social network / influencer feed.
- Complex project management and long-form journaling (keep it tight).

## Target users / Personas
- Busy professionals: want low-effort consistency and clarity.
- Self-improvers: already read the book, want the system implemented.
- Beginners: need guided habit design and gentle guardrails.

## Core user journey
1. Onboard: choose an identity theme (e.g., “I’m a fit person”, “I’m a consistent creator”).
2. Create one habit using a guided builder (implementation intention + habit stacking + 2-minute starter).
3. Configure cues (time/location/after X) and environment prompts.
4. Daily check-in: minimal, fast completion + optional evidence.
5. Weekly review: score what worked, adjust cues/friction/rewards, scale difficulty.

## Core features (MVP)

### 1) Identity-first onboarding
- Identity statement builder:
  - “I am the kind of person who ______.”
  - “Evidence I want to build is ______.”
- Optional identity “badge” or mantra displayed on home screen.
- Choose 1–3 identity areas (Health / Wealth / Relationships / Learning / Creativity).

### 2) Habit Builder (guided, opinionated)
Create a habit with:
- Clear habit name and intent
- Implementation intention:
  - “I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”
- Habit stacking:
  - “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
- 2-minute version:
  - Default starter habit: smallest viable action
- Scaling plan:
  - Phase 1: 2-minute version
  - Phase 2: standard version
  - Phase 3: stretch version (optional)

### 3) The 4 Laws mapped to product controls
Make it Obvious:
- Prominent cues: schedule, widgets, lock-screen prompts (platform dependent)
- “Environment checklist” per habit (e.g., set shoes by door)
- Visual trigger support (photo prompt / checklist)

Make it Attractive:
- Temptation bundling suggestions:
  - “Only allow [treat] while doing [habit]”
- Pair habits with enjoyable context (music/podcast prompt)
- “Why this matters” card tied to identity

Make it Easy:
- 2-minute mode default
- Reduce steps: one-tap complete, quick timer
- “Friction toggle”:
  - Add friction to bad habits (blocklists optional later)
  - Remove friction from good habits (prep reminders, pre-filled checklists)

Make it Satisfying:
- Immediate reward options:
  - “Completion celebration” (subtle)
  - Earn points toward chosen rewards (user-defined)
- Streaks are secondary; primary is “identity evidence” and “consistency rate”
- Visual progress: calendar heatmap and “evidence log”

### 4) Daily check-in (fast)
- Today view: top 1–5 habits, sorted by cue time
- One-tap completion
- Optional “evidence” capture:
  - quick note, photo, or 5-second reflection (“What did this prove about me?”)
- Missed habit flow:
  - “What got in the way?” (pre-set reasons)
  - Suggest a design fix mapped to the 4 laws

### 5) Habit Scorecard + Weekly review
- Weekly prompt:
  - What worked? What didn’t? Which law failed (obvious/attractive/easy/satisfying)?
- Auto-suggest adjustments:
  - change cue time, simplify, add environment trigger, add reward
- “Never miss twice” guardrail:
  - If missed once, next day prompts a smaller 2-minute version

## “Nice-to-have” (post-MVP)
- Templates by domain (gym, writing, saving money)
- AI habit coach (optional): converts goals into identity + habit plan; proposes 4-law fixes
- Integrations: Apple Health/Google Fit, calendar, reminders
- Social accountability: small private groups (not a feed)
- Bad-habit breaking mode (inverse 4 laws): invisible, unattractive, hard, unsatisfying

## Key screens (information architecture)
- Home / Today (habits + cues + one tap)
- Habit detail (identity link, cue, 2-min version, scaling, environment checklist)
- Add habit (wizard)
- Evidence log (identity proof timeline)
- Review (weekly scorecard + adjustments)
- Settings (notifications, privacy, data export)

## Data model (conceptual)
User
- id, timezone, preferences

IdentityTheme
- id, title, statement, values (optional)

Habit
- id, title, identity_theme_id
- implementation_intention: behaviour, time, location
- stack_anchor (text)
- versions: two_min, standard, stretch
- schedule (days/times)
- cue_type (time / after-habit / location)
- environment_actions (checklist)
- reward_config (points/reward)

HabitLog
- id, habit_id, date, status (done/missed/partial)
- evidence_note, evidence_media_url (optional)
- friction_reason (optional)

ReviewLog
- week_start, ratings, notes, chosen_adjustments

## Notifications (guardrails)
- Respect notification fatigue:
  - default: 1 reminder per habit window + gentle follow-up
- Smart reminders:
  - only remind for scheduled habits not completed
  - missed yesterday → today suggests 2-minute version

## Metrics (success measures)
- Activation: % who create first habit and complete within 24 hours
- Retention: 7-day and 30-day active usage
- Consistency rate per habit (completions / scheduled occurrences)
- Review participation rate (weekly)
- “Design iteration” rate (users adjusting cues/friction/rewards)

## Privacy & safety
- No medical claims; habit coaching is general self-improvement.
- Local-first preference where possible; encrypted storage for sensitive notes.
- Explicit permissions for photos/health integrations.
- Data export + delete account.

## Suggested tech (adjustable)
- Mobile: React Native (Expo) or native (Swift/Kotlin) depending on team
- Web: Next.js (TypeScript) on Vercel
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- UI: Tailwind (web) + a minimal component system
- Analytics: privacy-conscious event tracking (opt-in where required)

## MVP scope (4–8 weeks for a small team, depending on platform)
- Onboarding + identity statement
- Habit builder (implementation intention, stacking, 2-minute)
- Today screen + logging
- Weekly review + basic suggestions
- Basic notifications
- Simple progress views (calendar/consistency)

## Acceptance criteria (MVP)
- User can create a habit with identity link + cue + 2-minute version in < 2 minutes.
- Completing a habit takes < 3 seconds from Home.
- Weekly review produces at least 1 actionable adjustment per week.
- User can view “identity evidence” (logs/notes/photos) as a timeline.
- Works offline for daily check-ins; syncs when online.
